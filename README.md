## Information for future teams + the open source community
Hello! Spaghetteam is putting this project into the public domain for anyone to modify or develop further. Read on to understand the work we've already done and our ideas on where to take the project from here. 

### Purpose
The original purpose of this web app was to allow people with food texture sensitivities to better understand the textures of dishes listed on restaurant menus. 

### Research
Our market research has indicated that most online resources for people with food texture sensitivities are geared towards children. We performed interviews with people with food texture sensitivities and found that many people looked to multiple online sources to gain a better understanding of restaurant menu items' textures. Many people felt guilty over wasting food and money during times when they realized they would not be able to eat the meal they had ordered. 

### Design
The current design allows anyone with an account to edit the menu information of any restaurant. If we had more time to work on this project, we would have liked to implement page customization options for restaurant owners, promotions with local restaurants, a food journal feature, and more community engagement features. 

### Code
All code used to create this web app has been posted here: https://github.com/smwest3/spaghetteam-ajidex and is ready to fork.
